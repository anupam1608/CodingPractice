Quetion :   Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
            The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:  Input: 5
            Output: 2
            Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which 
            is 2 in base-10.

Solution :  input + output = 111....11 in binary format
            N + bitwiseComplement(N) = 11....11 = X
            bitwiseComplement(N) = X - N
Code :
            int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
                int x = 1;
                while(N>x) x = x * 2 + 1;
                return x - N;
        
            }
